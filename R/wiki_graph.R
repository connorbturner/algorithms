#'
#' A data frame that represents an example graph to use with the dijkstra()
#' function.
#'
#' @format The data frame contains 18 observations of 3 variables that
#' describe the graph's edges and their weights:
#'
#' v1: The starting vector of the edge
#'
#' v2: The destination vector of the edge
#'
#' w: The weight of the edge
#'
#' This example graph is based on the one shown at the top of this wikipedia
